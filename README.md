API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# Optional: Override default API URL for frontend
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/v1
```

### Backend Configuration

The backend uses the following key components:

- **LLM Handler**: `src/utils/llm_handler.py` - Manages Gemini LLM integration with enhanced safety filtering
- **Session Manager**: `src/utils/session_manager.py` - Handles conversation memory
- **Safety Filtering**: Built-in crisis intervention and medical advice prevention
- **API Routes**: `src/api/chat.py` - Chat endpoints and request handling

### Frontend Configuration

- **API Service**: `src/services/api.js` - Backend communication
- **Voice Hooks**: `src/hooks/useVoiceRecording.js` and `src/hooks/useTextToSpeech.js` - Full voice interaction
- **Components**: Modern React components with Tailwind CSS styling

## 🛡️ Safety & Privacy

- **No Data Persistence**: Conversations are not stored in any database
- **Session-Based Memory**: Context is maintained only during active sessions
- **Enhanced Safety Filtering**: AI responses are filtered for harmful content with crisis intervention
- **Crisis Support**: Automatic redirection to emergency services when needed
- **Privacy First**: No user data collection or tracking
- **Wellness Focus**: Responses include actionable recommendations for mental health and wellbeing

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Backend not connecting:**
```bash
# Check if backend is running
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Check logs
docker-compose logs backend
```

**Voice recording not working:**
- Ensure microphone permissions are granted in browser
- **Use Chrome or Edge browsers** (voice features are optimized for these)
- Check microphone volume in Windows settings if levels are low
- Use HTTPS in production (required for Web Speech API)

**API key issues:**
- Verify your Gemini API key is valid
- Ensure the .env file is in the correct location (backend)
- Check environment variable is loaded properly

### Browser Compatibility

- **Voice Features**: **Chrome recommended**
- **General Chat**: All modern browsers
- **HTTPS Required**: For voice features in production deployment
